              Your entire donation amount is given to the family in the form of vouchers they can redeem at the local supermarket.
              Families need more than just food to thrive. We give people the ability to buy food, toiletries, airtime or electricity.

              You can afford R250 a week, right? Because, let's face it, that isn't an amount of money that will make a huge difference to your life.
              And you can't buy booze in the lockdown, so you've already saved that money.

              We'll give you all the detail of how your money is spent. We collaborate with the supermarkets to account for every cent.
              And our system means that we don't need to spend any of your money on logistics.
